# Fawry-Challenge-2
This is a simple Java project for an online bookstore called book store. It has different types of books like paper books, ebooks, and demo books that canâ€™t be sold. I created a base book class and then made specific ones for each type. The program lets you add books, buy them using ISBN, and also remove old books from the store. I added a method to show all books in the inventory too. The Main class is used to test everything like adding, buying, and showing books.
